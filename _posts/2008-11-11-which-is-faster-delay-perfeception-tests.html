title: "Which Is Faster? Delay Perception Tests (Participation Appreciated)"
---

<div class="section">
    <p>
        <strong>Please participate</strong> in my <strong><a href="http://webignition.net/research/response-times/which-is-faster/" title="">two small, quick tests</a></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        You get to enjoy clicking two things, waiting for two things to happen and saying which of the two was faster. It should take no more than one minute.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm researching the extent to which people can or can't notice the delay between an action and a response.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, you click a button on a website, wait a little, then something happens. I'm trying to determine how small that 'wait a little' is before it no longer becomes noticeable.

        This is part of a <a href="http://webignition.net/articles/xml-vs-yaml-vs-json-a-study-to-find-answers/">performance comparison of popular data serialisation technologies</a> I'm currently conducting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Running through the tests may indirectly make the world a better place.
