        As a software developer, your appreciation of what you know
        progresses in waves. This is a process familiar to all software developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The process tends to be:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>learn something</li>
        <li>realise that with what you know you can make anything</li>
        <li>encounter someone or something that goes so far beyond this you realise you only knew very, very little</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        Through the discovering of programming and system design techniques and practices you realise, from time to time,
        that you know next to nothing and build in leaps and bounds on what you thought you understood.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I made web sites 15 or more years ago. These were simple, static web sites. They contained little of value and had about
        as much impact on people as a Basic program running on a BBC Micro. But they were on the Internet (the Internet of GeoCities
        and Angelfire), but still. They Were On The Internet!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Web sites give way to web applications. What is presented in a browser is just the tip of the iceberg and it's behind the
        scenes that holds the engineering excitement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You start making things that actual real people actually really use.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Just as your understanding of software development grows in ways that allow you to overcome the obstacles of scale 
        that you were too inexperienced to apprecaite, so does the scale at which you operate grow in the extent with which
        it impacts first people and then the Internet itself.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When you reach the point where the software you create isn't just a presentational sprinkling, when the software you
        create is used by others to add content and presentation to the web, when the systems you build allow others to
        put sites out on the web, when the systems you build are used by people who build the web to make the web better, you're
        no longer making web sites, you're no longer making software in isolation, you're making the Internet.
