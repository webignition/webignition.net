        In my most recent job I put in place a continuous integration system that spawned an army of quality-related
        jobs the instant changes were pushed to a central git repository for a given site.

        I wanted to do more but I was made redundant. I love automating testing and now I have plenty of time.

        I recently started developing <a href="http://simplytestable.com">simplytestable.com</a>. It's a professional
        automated web front-end testing service.

        My most recent job was with a small agency. Very small. Threre were no testers, QA was ad-hoc. The impression
        was that there wasn't enough of a demand for an actual tester. I was the developer and I was the tester. It 
        wasn't the most effective arrangement for delivering quality but that's the way it was.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thankfully I had relatively free reign to make things better. I automated and I loved it. I put in place git for
        version control, Jenkins for continuous integration and a slew of post-push Jenkins jobs per site to carry out a
        range of quality tests that took on routine front-end testing. An army of CI jobs jumped to action the instant
        changes were pushed to a central git repository for a site.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It was magical; I watched the Jenkins build output as it verified, across all pages in a site,
        technical aspects such as HTML and CSS validity, as well as examining non-technical aspects such as checking for the presence
        of over 4000 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines">commonly misspelled words</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Automated testing is sometimes inspired by laziness, by the need to avoid the monotony of tedium.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        On a larger scale, automated testing is a necessity: the careful verification of a range of technical and non-technical quality
        aspects cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way. A 1000-page website, for example, cannot feasibly support manual per-page
        examination.
