title: "Symfony Container-Aware Migrations"

<div class="section">
    <p>
        The <a href="http://app.simplytestable.com">Simply Testable core application</a> uses
        <a href="http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-migrations/en/latest/reference/introduction.html">Doctine migrations</a>
        to handle database schema changes. Combined with the <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMigrationsBundle">DoctrineMigrationsBundle</a> this provides
        an excellent means for automatically generating migrations based on entity changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the right way to handle schema migrations for a Symfony application. I've been looking for a comparable way
        of handling data migrations.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm talking about application-dependent data required at install time upon which the application is fundamentally dependent
        if it is to operate as intended.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Each web site test job is associated with a user. The default public user enables free tests to be run. The service
        can't reasonably work without this. Failing to manually add the default public user during install time is one point
        of failure we can avoid by ensuring the relevant data is applied via a migration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vanilla Doctrine migrations aren't great for importing data <em>in the context of a Symfony application</em>. For other applications
        that use Doctine as the ORM, Doctrine migrations may be just fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within a vanilla migration, you can create and persist entities or you can resort to plain old SQL. This is fine if your entity is
        fully-functional (or at least sufficiently-functional) outside of a Symfony application context. This might also be fine if you're
        confident in forming the correct SQL statements, however as we're working at the application level, that SQL even exists is not
        something we should need to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'd like to be able to work within migrations at the same level of abstraction as I'm working within when dealing with controllers,
        entities and other application-level abstractions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's how I'd create the default public user at the application level:
    </p>
<pre>$user = new User();
$user->setEmail('public@simplytestable.com');
$user->setPlainPassword('public');
$user->setUsername('public');

$userManager = $this->container->get('fos_user.user_manager');        
$userManager->updateUser($user);</pre>
    <p>
        This depends on the Symfony container to get the FOSUserBundle's UserManager. In the context of a vanilla migration this
        can't happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        What we need is a migration that has access to a Symfony container. This part of the puzzle is straightforward: Symfony
        provides the <code>ContainerAwareInterface</code> interface.
    </p>    
    <p>
        A class that implements this interface gives us a migration
        that can be aware of a Symfony container:
    </p>
<pre>
&lt;?php
namespace webignition\ContainerAwareMigration;

use Doctrine\DBAL\Migrations\AbstractMigration,
    Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Schema,
    Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerAwareInterface,
    Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerInterface;

abstract class ContainerAwareMigration extends AbstractMigration implements ContainerAwareInterface
{
    /**
     *
     * @var Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\ContainerInterface
     */
    protected $container;
    

    /**
     *
     * @param ContainerInterface $container 
     */
    public function setContainer(ContainerInterface $container = null) {
        $this->container = $container;
    }
}</pre>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/webignition/ContainerAwareMigration">webignition/ContainerAwareMigration</a>
        provides this class. Clone as you see fit. If you're using composer, simply add a dependency:
    </p>
<pre>"require": {
    "webignition/container-aware-migration": "*"
},</pre>    
    <p>
        The second part of the puzzle is a little more complex. Your migration needs a Symfony container injected into
        it. No matter how container-aware your migration is, a container won't magically appear within it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineMigrationsBundle">DoctrineMigrationsBundle</a>, when running
        migrations, iterates over and executes all migrations that you have created. It's at this point we can
        sensibly inject a Symfony container into a migration that is container-aware. A fork at
        <a href="https://github.com/webignition/DoctrineMigrationsBundle">webignition/DoctrineMigrationsBundle</a>
        does so as it's aware, at the point of configuring migrations, of both the Symfony container and the migration.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are just two simple steps to get the same working in your Symfony application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firstly, update your composer dependencies:
    </p>
<pre>"require": {       
    "webignition/doctrine-migrations-bundle": "*",
    "webignition/container-aware-migration": "*"
},</pre>
    <p>
        Note: if you already have a dependency for <code>doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle</code> you'll need
        to remove this from your composer.json and delete vendor/doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly, update relevant migration classes to extend <code>webignition/ContainerAwareMigration</code>.
        You can then make use of the Symfony container within your <code>postUp()</code> and <code>postDown()</code>
        methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a real-life example where we're using a migration to create the fos_user table and then
        create the default public user:
    </p>
<pre>&lt;?php
namespace Application\Migrations;

use webignition\ContainerAwareMigration\ContainerAwareMigration,
    Doctrine\DBAL\Schema\Schema,
    SimplyTestable\ApiBundle\Entity\User;

class Version20120712145445_create_fos_user extends ContainerAwareMigration
{
    public function up(Schema $schema)
    {
        $this->abortIf($this->connection->getDatabasePlatform()->getName() != "mysql");
        $this->addSql("CREATE TABLE fos_user ... ");
    }

    public function down(Schema $schema)
    {
        $this->abortIf($this->connection->getDatabasePlatform()->getName() != "mysql");
        $this->addSql("DROP TABLE fos_user");
    }
    
    public function postUp(Schema $schema) {
        $user = new User();
        $user->setEmail('public@simplytestable.com');
        $user->setPlainPassword('public');
        $user->setUsername('public');
        
        $userManager = $this->container->get('fos_user.user_manager');        
        $userManager->updateUser($user);        
    }
}</pre>
